STORY TELLING
People understand and remember stories.

For me Information Architecture (IA) is the "where" and "how" blocks of related information are grouped and then placed to tell the *story* of the site:

  - in a logical way: makes absolute sense to the end user
  - invites/entices/causes the end user to take the next step, i.e. turn the page in the story

Before you define blocks of information you have to have a story.

For example, the story might be: "I'm a great Web site for finding a job...a job that is perfect for you, you should join me, if you do you will have access to tons of perfect jobs and your life will change for the better forever!"


BLOCKS OF INFORMATION

In this short story I see 3 blocks of information: 1) what is the site in 10 words or less, 2) how do I join - a sign-up section, 3) and an area that describes the benefits of the site - maybe user testimonials.

Aside from the main story, also consider the basic information blocks that most Web sites require:

 - a logo
 - legalese (Copyright, ToS, Privacy)
 - non-legal footer type info (Feedback, About, Contact, Site Map).


PLACEMENT

This is obvious but worth spending time on. After I define blocks of information, I start to think about where they will be placed. I want to call attention to different parts of the story depending on its relevance and importance in the story.

Basically I think like a newspaper layout editor. I also "borrow from the best" to get ideas about my layout by seeing what’s out there on the Web.

I highly recommend the book:

"Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug - http://www.sensible.com/index.html

It’s a good read and everything he says is so darn obvious, and all there in one great reference.


FEEDBACK

One very important thing to practice when designing interfaces is do nothing in isolation, and consider everything you think as intuitive to be wrong! (until proven otherwise)

You have to get feedback from your end users and refine. If you can't get to them, then ask your neighbor, a friend, or try something like:

Iterating is key.


Finally when architecting remember that less is more and KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).
