Section I - Setting up the Foundation
-------------------------------------

Section I is comprised of three chapters written to help developers set up and understand the components of a stellar Ruby on Rails front end code base. In [Chapter 1][] we begin with our **Foundation Markup**, i.e. view templates. In [Chapter 2][] we add **Foundation Styles**, CSS, and in [Chapter 3][] we explore **Mobile on Rails**. Our goals in these three chapters are to:

1. Demonstrate how to start a Rails applications out right – soup to nuts – from the front end view coders perspective.
2. Provide example code and the files you will need for a stellar front end code foundation, which you can freely use or modify (with no attribution) for your own projects.
