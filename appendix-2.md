### Frameworks

In so far as responsive frameworks go, the following article gives you a nice comparison:

Here is a brief framework roundup worth taking a look at for your project.

#### Twitter Bootstrap

I like [Twitter Bootstrap][]. It's a great place to learn about best practices for any application or framework, and you can get some amazing designs in absolutely no time. It's well-documented, but here's the problem: it's built on [Less][], and use it and your site will look pretty much like everyone else's. Of course you can override styles, but I'm just sayin'.

Getting it to work with Rails is not impossible, hardly, but if you go this path there are some choices to consider:

#### Blueprint

[Blueprint][], in my opinion, is the granddaddy of all frameworks. I used to use Blueprint all of the time, and Compass makes it readily available. It's tried-and-true, and a good choice, but I rarely use it these days. I'm not too crazy about it's look and feel. It does seem to be more of a minimalist framework - which is not a bad thing.

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

#### YUI

 I've used YUI and personally I'm not too crazy about its grid system which is a pretty major component to any framework - so I generally stay away.

#### Foundation 3

I haven't used Foundation, but I'm interested.

#### Skeleton

I also haven't use Skeleton, but soon enough.
