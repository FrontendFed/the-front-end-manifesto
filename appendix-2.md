### Frameworks

Frameworks give you a whole boatload of base styles that are instantly accessible through your HTML tags or specified class names. Frameworks include base font sizes and rhythm, default formats for almost every kind of HTML tag, and by simply dropping in the frameworks class names you can add some great looking styles to your project that are built to work, with very few hitches, across all browsers. On top of that you get grid systems, prebuilt scripts for commonly used functions like pop-ups, modals and menu systems. The list goes on.

In so far as responsive frameworks go, the following article gives you a nice comparison:

Here is a brief framework roundup worth taking a look at for your project.

#### Compass

So right off the bat I have to say that I love [Compass][]. It's powerful, it's well-documented, it's widely used, there are a ton of extensions for it, and it generally makes life easier for me.

> Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.

I'm pretty biased on this one, and all the [starter CSS ][] files we will use in our foundation styles incorporate Compass so there's not much else to say other than that it almost doesn't belong in this section since it's really not a framework but rather a utility. It's here though because you can add all kinds of framework components like:

- [Responsive grids for Compass][Responsive Grids] or [Zen Grids][]
- [Sassy Buttons][] or [Fancy Buttons][]

...and essentially create your own look and feel. Most traditional frameworks on the other hand just give you styles. If you want to break free it takes some tinkering.

When working with Compass the following resource may be useful to you:

#### Twitter Bootstrap

I like [Twitter Bootstrap][]. It's a great place to learn about best practices for any application or framework, and you can get some amazing designs in absolutely no time. It's well-documented, but here's the problem: it's built on [Less][], and use it and your site will look pretty much like everyone else's. Of course you can override styles, but I'm just sayin'.

Getting it to work with Rails is not impossible, hardly, but if you go this path there are some choices to consider:

#### Blueprint

[Blueprint][], in my opinion, is the granddaddy of all frameworks. I used to use Blueprint all of the time, and Compass makes it readily available. It's tried-and-true, and a good choice, but I rarely use it these days. I'm not too crazy about it's look and feel. It does seem to be more of a minimalist framework - which is not a bad thing.

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

#### YUI

 I've used YUI and personally I'm not too crazy about its grid system which is a pretty major component to any framework - so I generally stay away.

#### Foundation 3

I haven't used Foundation, but I'm interested.

#### Skeleton

I also haven't use Skeleton, but soon enough.
