### Frameworks

Frameworks give you a whole boatload of base styles that are instantly accessible through your HTML tags or specified class names. Frameworks include base font sizes and rhythm, default formats for almost every kind of HTML tag, and by simply dropping in the frameworks class names you can add some great looking styles to your project that are built to work, with very few hitches, across all browsers. On top of that you get grid systems, prebuilt scripts for commonly used functions like pop-ups, modals and menu systems. The list goes on.

In so far as responsive frameworks go, the following article gives you a nice comparison:

- [Responsive CSS Framework Comparison][Framework Comparison]

Here is a brief framework roundup worth taking a look at for your project.

#### Compass

So right off the bat I have to say that I love [Compass][]. It's powerful, it's well-documented, it's widely used, there are a ton of extensions for it, and it generally makes life easier for me.

> Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.

I'm pretty biased on this one, and all the [starter CSS ][] files we will use in our foundation styles incorporate Compass so there's not much else to say other than that it almost doesn't belong in this section since it's really not a framework but rather a utility. It's here though because you can add all kinds of framework components like:

- [Responsive grids for Compass][Responsive Grids] or [Zen Grids][]
- [Sassy Buttons][] or [Fancy Buttons][]

...and essentially create your own look and feel. Most traditional frameworks on the other hand just give you styles. If you want to break free it takes some tinkering.

When working with Compass the following resource may be useful to you:

#### Twitter Bootstrap

I like [Twitter Bootstrap][]. It's a great place to learn about best practices for any application or framework, and you can get some amazing designs in absolutely no time. It's well-documented, but here's the problem: it's built on [Less][], and use it and your site will look pretty much like everyone else's. Of course you can override styles, but I'm just sayin'.

> Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

Getting it to work with Rails is not impossible, hardly, but if you go this path there are some choices to consider:

#### Blueprint

[Blueprint][], in my opinion, is the granddaddy of all frameworks. I used to use Blueprint all of the time, and Compass makes it readily available. It's tried-and-true, and a good choice, but I rarely use it these days. I'm not too crazy about it's look and feel. It does seem to be more of a minimalist framework - which is not a bad thing.

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

#### YUI

 I've used YUI and personally I'm not too crazy about its grid system which is a pretty major component to any framework - so I generally stay away.

> YUI is a free, open source JavaScript and CSS library for building richly interactive web applications.

#### Foundation 3

I haven't used Foundation, but I'm interested.

> The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.
\- [Zurb website][]

#### Skeleton

I also haven't use Skeleton, but soon enough.

### Grid Systems

You just can't believe how many grid system there are out there so here is a roundup for you to choose from (in alphabetical order):

1.  [320 and Up][]

    > ‘320 and Up’ is a lightweight, easy to use and content first responsive web design boilerplate.

2.  [34Grid][]

    > 34Grid is a Responsive Grid System based on "equally distributed columns" layout basis. In contrast to other great grid systems (@see bottom of page), 34Grid provides equally distributed columns for each row. (and also column complements for inequal distributions)

3.  [Columnal][]

    > The Columnal CSS grid system is a “remix” of a couple others with some custom code thrown in. The elastic grid system is borrowed from cssgrid.net, while some code inspiration (and the idea for subcolumns) are taken from 960.gs.

4.  [Frameless][]

    > Dig responsive design? Hate fluid grids? Try a Frameless grid.

5.  [Golden Grid System ][]

    > A folding grid for responsive design.

6.  [Fluid Baseline Grid System][]

    > The FBG system was built with typographic standards in mind and combines principals of fluid-column layouts, baseline grids and mobile-first responsive design into a resolution independent and device agnostic framework.

7.  [Responsive GS][]

    > Fluid grid CSS framework for fast, intuitive development of responsive websites. Available in 12, 16 and 24 columns with media queries for all standard devices, clearfix, and optional reset.

8.  [Responsive Grid System][]

    > The Responsive Grid System isn't a framework. It's not a boilerplate either. It's a quick, easy & flexible way to create a responsive web site.

9.  [rwdgrid][]

    > rwdgrid is just another Grid system based on popular 960grid , which is responsive and ranges from mobile, tablet, laptops and wide screen displays.

10. [SimpleGrid][]

    > Responsive. Infinite nesting. One class per element. Simple.

11. [1140 CSS Grid][]

    > The 1140 grid fits perfectly into a 1280 monitor. On smaller monitors it becomes fluid and adapts to the width of the browser.

12. [Gridiculous][]

    > Gridiculous was created after I tried out a bunch of different responsive grids and realized that none of them offered all of the features I required. First and foremost, I wanted to make sure that the grid would work from a large desktop monitor through to a tablet and all the way down to a mobile phone. That's why Gridiculous starts off at 1200px and works itself down to 320px.
