### Font Services and Tools

The font services below are listed in alphabetical order, some are free and others subscription-based, but together they represent what I consider be the best font services out there.

The tools I've listed, if needed, will help you deliver a superior typographic experience for your end-users.

#### Services

1. [Font Squirrel][]

### Tools

1.  [Lettering.JS][]

    > A jQuery plugin for radical web typography - Web type is exploding all over the web but CSS currently doesn't offer complete down-to-the-letter control. So we created a jQuery plugin to give you that control.

2.  [FitText.js][]

    > A jQuery plugin for inflating web type - FitText makes font-sizes flexible. Use this plugin on your fluid or responsive layout to achieve scalable headlines that fill the width of a parent element.
