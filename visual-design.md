Visual Design
-------------

The [last chapter][] was about Information Architecture, so design really goes beyond it's scope, however, [design is part of storytelling][Story Design] so let's see if we can in the very least point you in the right direction in visual design. I say point you in the right direction because visual design is a complete different skill set than front end coding.

Up until now, we basically have a pretty blank wireframe: function before form. We need to add some spice to it.

> Firstly, think about what your pages do, not what they look like. Let your design flow from the services which they will provide to your users, rather than from some overarching idea of what you want pages to look like. Let form follow function, rather than trying to take a particular design and make it "work".

\- [A Dao of Web Design][Dao] by John Allsopp

Just by looking at your site your users should be able to understand what they're looking at, your website must communicate it's story. To illustrate how simple this can be take a look at this 2007 website concept:

It demonstrates to me the simplicity of storytelling and engaging the user, and ultimately delivering a message to entice an action.

In the case of "View Thought" part of the story is: "We are a great website **design** [emphasis supplied], development and user experience shop...we pay special attention to what your users will see," so we better deliver some great graphic design on top of architecture and layout that will help communicate this story! To do so we will use a combination of fonts, color, images, and anything else I can think of, to help View Thought tell it's story in such a way that users just get it.

### Look and Feel

The combination of color, typefaces (fonts), branding, and images are the cornerstones of a sites look and feel. What follows are some ideas and resources to help you create your site's look and feel:

- Use a framework. We listed several frameworks you can use in the [Frameworks][] section of the Appendix.

- Reverse engineer pieces of things you already like.

- Find a plug-in.

- Hire a graphic designer. With your layout set via our wireframe work half of the designers work is done. Now he or she needs to pull it all together with a stellar look and feel. When hiring a designer, make sure you let them know that the layout you have in place is not set in stone. This way your designer can add their experience to the project. Here are some resources for finding graphic designers:

- Get a freebie and port it over to your application.

- Buy a template. Templates are significantly less expensive than hiring a graphic designer. As a front end coder implementing them into your layout should be a breeze. Here are some template resources:

- Read a tutorial.

### Color

> There are many contributing factors that go into making a good visual design, but one of the simplest ways to do this is through the use of colour. The colour palette used in a design can have such a profound effect on a visual design that it almost feels like you’re cheating. It’s easy to add more and more subtle shades of colour to add a sense of sophistication and complexity to a design, but it dilutes the overall visual impact. When I design, I almost have a rule that only allows me to use a very limited colour palette.
