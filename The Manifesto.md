Front End Coders Manifesto
--------------------------

**When I code I will:**

1. Seek perfection/excellence.

2. Write beautiful code.

3. Future proof my code.

4. Test across all major browsers.

5. Test in front of "real-life" users.

6. Provide for the mobile experience.

7. Employ progressive enhancements.

8. Be consistent.

9. Keep my code well organized.

10. Keep my code DRY.

11. Think in terms of all use cases including and especially accessibility.

12. Provide intelligent and semantically correct hooks and snippets of code for my backend team.

13. Abstract logic out of views, and keep view code out of controllers.

14. Design/architect/code for the end user, not for me or my team.

15. KISS (keep it simple stupid)

16. Sufficiently comment or document my code (in a style guide) so that the next person can make sense of it.


I will not use third-party plug-ins that do not allow me to easily style an application and/or change the underlying HTML like Formtastic or jQuery UI. I'm just sayin' - Besides, this is a manifesto!
