### Styles

For your applications foundation styles we'll use my base CSS files, or you can make up your own, but before you add styles to your application, and if you're planning to use Compass, you need to set it up.

#### Compass Set Up

1.  Add 'compass-rails' to your gemfile. For more explicit directions from the gem source take a look at: [compass-rails][]

2.  Run "bundle exec compass init" and then delete the 3 stylesheets generated by Compass. We're going to use our own.

3.  Add the following commented out code to your config/compass.rb file generated in step one:

        # To allow compass to import partials from subdirectories per:
        # http://blog.55minutes.com/2012/01/getting-compass-to-work-with-rails-31-and-32/
        # additional_import_paths = ["app/assets/stylesheets/<name>", "app/assets/stylesheets/<name>"]
        #
        # To compile in the necessary debugging information for FireSass.
        # sass_options = {:debug_info => true}

    I add these because chances are I may need them. You should definitely check out [FireSass][]. It allows you to see exactly which sass partial styles are coming from.

4.  Delete your application.css file and replace with application.scss. 

    NOTE: Your base application file needs to use the .scss syntax, however, other partials can use the .sass syntax, which is my preference.

5.  Use @import to organize styles rather than Sprockets. Add the following reminder at the top of application.scss:
        
        /*
         * Important! Do *not* use Sprockets "require" syntax.
         * Use @import to include other stylesheets and Compass mixins.
         */

    NOTE: You can use sprockets require syntax, however per the explanation found at of the [compass-rails][] gem source it is probably not a good idea.

6.  If you find your system has a problem with sass partials and underscores when precompiling, add the following to your config/application.rb file:

        # Precompile *all* assets, except those that start with underscore per:
        # http://blog.55minutes.com/2012/01/getting-compass-to-work-with-rails-31-and-32/
        config.assets.precompile << /(^[^_\/]|\/[^_])[^\/]*$/

That's pretty much it!

Some additional resources for working with Compass include:

- [How I Use Compass With Rails 3.1][How I Use Compass]
- [Sass, Compass, and the Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline][Asset Pipeline]

#### The Styles

Now that Compass is set up, grab everything from here:

- https://github.com/maxxiimo/base-css

...and paste these files and subfolder into your assets/styles directory. Simple as that. Here is what your page will look like:

![][Basic HTML with Styles]

It's pretty basic, but much better than before.

#### What Did We Just Do?

We essentially added some very basic css and resets, but more important than this – there are really not that many styles included – is the way in which we organized our styles. As you move along any project, stylesheets can become behemoths, unmanageable, and downright confusing. To avoid this it's highly advisable to start a project with some kind of organizational structure in place from the get-go.

To learn more about CSS Organization, check out the CSS Organization section of the [Organization][] chapter. This section describes why and how to organize styles within application.scss and more. The HTML Organization section covers why and how to organize your markup foundation. Although this book is designed for developers who already know their way around a Rails application, it's worth taking a look at.






### CSS Organization

I can't stress how important it is to start a project with some kind of organizational structure in place. Even if you don't know what shape the application is going to take, it will serve you well to have a basic structure and styles in place like the one I'm going to share with you here. As you move along you will fill in all the placeholders and partials, and the styles are common to almost any project.

#### Rails Manifest vs. Sass Partials

There is nothing wrong with using Rails manifest capabilities, however, since we're using sass my preferred method of organizing is to use application.scss as a partials manifest file, almost like a table of contents. I use the following structure for most of my projects:

    application.scss
    
    /*
     * Important! Do *not* use Sprockets "require" syntax.
     * Use @import to include other stylesheets and Compass mixins.
     */
    
    
    /* DEFINITIONS
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "define";
    
    
    /* MIXINS
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "compass";
    
    
    /* RESETS
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "resets/normalize_h5bp";
    // @import "resets/normalize";
    // @import "compass/reset";
    // @import "resets/reset_meyer";
    
    
    /* BASIC STRUCTURE
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "layout";
    // @import "grid";
    
    
    /* TYPOGRAPHY
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "typography";
    
    
    /* MISCELLANEOUS
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "misc";
    @import "sprites";
    
    
    /* NAVIGATION
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "navigation";
    
    
    /* FORMS
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "forms";
    
    
    /* PAGES
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "pages";
    
    
    /* DEVELOPERS - staging area, new styles belong here !!!DO NOT INTEGRATE!!!
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "developers";
    
    
    /* APPLICATION - ad hoc code under this line
      ============================================================================ */
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    /* LAST - second part of HTML 5 Boilerplate
      ============================================================================ */
    @import "resets/normalize_h5bp_p2";
    @import "resets/normalize_h5bp_p2_print";


Why the "=" underlines? It helps me find things when I browse CSS output.

I can't stress enough the importance of modularizing your styles. Use partials. Doing so will keep things organized. The degree of separation/modularization depends on your personal and/or teams preferences and project needs.

1.  Group related partials together by either prefixing related partials with a common subject:

        _subject1.
        
        _subject1_

2.  Group related snippets of code together in larger themed partials:


3.  Group things in folders:


See the section on "Resets" for an overview on which resets are available to you. I include four major reset styles in my application file, uncomment the one I plan to use for a particular project.

Use a "definitions" section to set global variables such as $base-font, $base-font-size, etc. Here is an example of a definition structure I usually start with:

[Upload to Github.]

Use a "layout" section to style major elements and component areas such as html and body tags, or header and footer areas. This section is also good place for grid styles. As you might have noticed, the partial grid is called in this example. This partial in some of my projects ports a sass version of YUI grids, and also Compasses Grid Backgrounds which in a nutshell:

"The grid-background mixins allow you to generate fixed, fluid and elastic grid-images on-the-fly using css3 gradients. These can be used for testing both horizontal and vertical grids."

Use the "typography" section to style major typographical elements such as paragraphs, fonts, links, etc. These typographical styles are standard across all pages unless redefined in subsequent partials.

"miscellaneous" is a catchall for things you would like to appear earlier on in the stylesheet. I include two write off the bat. The first has an assortment of general styles I use while I'm building a front end. The second is for sprites, whether I'm using compasses built in Sprite engine, or building them on my own.

"navigation" could be part of another section, or even contained within another partial, however, experiences has shown me that a lot of things can happen to it, styles can become quite large, and there can be more than one navigation or even type of medication depending on user, so it's best to give it its own section. The main navigations parent tag <nav> or more appropriately %nav does belong in the layout partial since through it you might control layout factors such as position or width.

"forms" it is self-evident. One comment about forms, I really dislike any form generator that doesn't easily let you change its underlying HTML structure, or is not that obvious as to where the underlying structure lies. I have consulted for numerous companies who started with such plug-ins only to realize how boxed in they were later on. Just a word of caution. Anyway, forms oftentimes get pretty complicated so here are some labeling title ideas you can use within your forms partial:

"pages" will hold the bulk of your code, i.e. each page or functional area of your application. You can organize them all within one partial, or separate them into their own partials and call them in the pages section, or a combination of this.

The "developers" section is exactly what it says, a staging area for code. It's good to designating the area as a staging area so that one team or individual can be the gatekeeper to code entering stylesheets. This ensures that things remain organized, DRY, follow the stylesheet standards, and at a bare minimum provide a form of quality control.

"application" could be a place for anything that did not fit in or really needs to trump all styles before it.

"last" is  a reminder that those styles need to appear last.

#### Use Labeling System

Within stylesheets use a system of labeling in order to modularize and better organize/manage related styles. It's good to precede the title name with "/* ". This way you can easily search for specific things like "/* Form" and not pick up every form item in your styles. 

    /* MAJOR SECTION IN SASS
      ============================================================================

    /* Heading in sass
      -----------------------
    
    /* subdivision, description, comment in sass

    

    /* MAJOR SECTION IN SCSS
      ============================================================================ */
    
    /* Heading in scss
      ----------------------- */
    
    /* subdivision, description, comment in scss */


I like the above sequence, but some other examples include:

    /* -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     Something major in here. Maybe a long description?
    
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
    
    
    /* =============================================================================
       Major Section
       ========================================================================== */
    
    
    /* =============================================================================
     * Major Section (famous previous but for .sass)
     * =============================================================================
    
    
    /*
     * Comment in here, title, description, etc.
     */
    
    
    /* Comment in here, title, description, etc.
     * More of the same.
     * And a 3rd line maybe. */
    
    
    Once upon a time ago I used to always use this:

    /* Title
    ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
    
    
    /* Subtitle
    -----------–--- */
    
    (use the same number of trailing dashes after the last letter for all subtitles - in this case 4.)


    /* further subdivision or comment */

##### Subtitle Examples

By far the most used labeling level in your stylesheets will be "subtitles". Try to group like things or elements and label them with an eye on searching for the title in the future. Here are some examples for form elements:


    /* common
    ------------- */
    
    
    /* labels
    ------------- */
    
    
    /* inputs
    ------------- */
    
    
    /* checks and radials
    ------------------------- */
    
    
    /* text areas
    ----------------- */
    
    
    /* selects
    -------------- */
    
    
    /*  buttons
    -------------- */
    
    
    /* link buttons
    ------------------- */
    
    
    /* misc
    ----------- */

#### Naming Conventions

I have my way of naming styles, and I've seen things all over the board.  Here's My Recommendation, keep it semantic, short, and use underscores between words. Of course with everything there's always caveats.

##### Semantic

I've never been too crazy for style names that really have no meaning like :class => 'H2603A'...Okay maybe I'm exaggerating, but I think you get the point. Try to use something that has meaning and can be recognized for what it is like :class => 'header', but by the same token try not to get super specific about the contents. Like it's probably not good to use something like, :class => 'johns_comments', because what happens if John gets fired in the comments becomes Frank's?

There is no sure hit formula for naming classes, just keep these things in mind.

I found these articles to be really eye-opening or interesting regarding the subject:



##### Short

Try to keep it under 10 characters! I've seen some pretty long class names out there in the wild, and I'm not too crazy about them. They take up too much room. On the flip side use caution when choosing something super super short.  For example I sometimes use :id => 'ft' to ID the footer. I feel fine doing this since the tag is called <footer>.

##### CamelCase, Underscores, Hyphens, Concatenated?

...whatever you use stick with it. Be consistent.

    :id => 'pageHeader'
    :id => 'page_header'
    :id => 'page-header'
    :id => 'pageheader'


Personally, I like to keep it simple and find one-worders that fit, then concatenate, but two words tops! ...and only when the words are small enough and distinguishable. Then if I must, I use one of the other methods above and only one throughout my styles and only if absolutely necessary, i.e. I don't have an opinion on which is better. My method isn't consistent enough for you? You're probably right, but I feel like I have mastered the art of class naming well enough that it feels and looks consistent (and pretty).

Here's some more opinions on the matter:

[CSS: camelCase vs under_score][aB vs. a_b]
[Hyphens or underscores in CSS and HTML identifiers?][Identifiers]
[CSS: CamelCase Seriously Sucks!][Sucks]

#### Keep it DRY!

Try not, no, Don't Repeat Yourself! In CSS this means consolidating where possible, using variables, includes, and mixins.

##### Consolidating

Suppose for example in this no duh! contrived example I have two major sections to my layout. One holds my main content, and the other is an aside (I'm using Twitter Bootstrap thus the .row and .span's):

  .container
    .row
      .span9
        #main{:role => "main"}
          = yield
      .span3
        %aside
          <Some content here.>

The corresponding styles:

    #main
      padding: 0 19px
      background-color: $white
      border: 1px solid $border
      @include border-radius(8px)
    
    .span3 aside
      padding: 0 19px
      background-color: $white
      border: 1px solid $border
      @include border-radius(8px)

So to keep it DRY:

    #main,
    .span3 aside
      padding: 0 19px
      background-color: $white
      border: 1px solid $border
      @include border-radius(8px)

...and we cut the number of lines of code in half! Do that wherever it makes sense. In this example both styles live in the same place in my stylesheet and are related to one another so combining them makes absolute sense.

##### Variables

While variables do not explicitly DRY up your code, they kind of do and here's how; in the code above I specify a variable for the background-color of $white. At first glance you might think why not just use #FFF or "white", as if in this case "6 in one hand, half a dozen in the other" holds true, but what if later in the applications lifecycle I want to use a different shade of white? For example #FCFCFC. I would have to find every single instance of either #FFF or "white" and swap it out with the new value. By using variables, which I always locate in my _define.sass style partial, I can make the change in one instance and affect styles everywhere the variable is used. Not quite DRY, but kinda.

##### Includes



##### Mixins
