### Jason Santa Maria On Web Typography

Jason Santa Maria, in a presentation at [Build 2011][] called [On Web Typography][] spoke about picking typefaces. I've transcribed it here in part and slightly paraphrased:

1.  Questions to ask yourself: What are you using it for? How will it be used? Under what conditions? From the slide "considerations":

    > **Dimensions**
    > Are there requirements for how much text must fit in a given region?

    > **Special Features** - Do you require special features your typefaces
    > What features do you require? Multiple weights, lining &amp; old-style figures, small caps, etc?

    > **Prolonged Reading** -
    > Is this a book or a long format periodical?

    > **Internationalization** -
    > Does a given font support all the special characters of the language to be used?


2.  Readability and distinctness in characters matters. Will the typeface cause the reader to become confused, or tired of reading it?

3.  Avoid readymades. Fonts with design baked in.

4.  Develop your own personal palette. Find typefaces that you like, that you gravitate to, and keep using them. Get to know a typeface.

5.  Get to know the history of a typeface. When was it designed? Why was it designed? This should complement not contradict your text/subject.

6.  Find typefaces that embody a mental association: terms you want to associate with the design.

7.  Pair fonts that are designed together, they will work well together. The serif for the body text, the sans serif for the supplementary stuff like page numbers and captions.

8.  Use alternatives for commonly used typefaces get the same type of feel without being the same as everyone else. For example Helvetica. You can use an alternative rather than the frequently used Helvetica itself: FF Dagny, Proxima Nova, Museo Sans, Prehematica Slabserif.

9.  Try it out! Test out your ideas. See how it looks. See how it reads. See how it feels. In long-form text, in short-form text. Small columns, wide columns. Big text, small text. Doing this gives you a very real impression on how other people are going to see it.
